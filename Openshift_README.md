# Cluster

An OpenShift cluster is a group of master and worker nodes that work together to run containerized applications. The control plane manages the cluster, while worker nodes run the workloads (pods). A cluster provides scalability, high availability, networking, storage, and security for all workloads.

In OpenShift, the load balancer (LB) sits in front of the control plane and routes traffic to the master nodes.

Each worker has:

kubelet

kube-proxy

CRI-O (container runtime)

# Projects and Namespaces 

namespace = Kubernetes term (technical, basic)

Project = OpenShift term (namespace + extras)


A Namespace is a logical isolation boundary in Kubernetes used to group and isolate resources.

Key Technical Points:

Core Kubernetes resource (apiVersion: v1, kind: Namespace)

Provides resource isolation and scoping

Supports ResourceQuotas and LimitRanges

Applies NetworkPolicies per namespace

RBAC operates at namespace scope

Names must be unique within a cluster

Does not contain extra metadata like display names

#oc get ns

Shows raw Kubernetes namespaces

Includes system namespaces (openshift-, kube-, etc.)

A Project is an OpenShift-specific wrapper around a Kubernetes Namespace that adds additional metadata, RBAC defaults, and UI-friendly attributes.

Key Technical Points:

OpenShift API resource (project.openshift.io)

Automatically creates an underlying Namespace

Adds:

Display name

Description

Annotations & labels

Default RBAC bindings (admin, edit, view roles)

Integrates with OpenShift OAuth and user permissions

Shown in OpenShift Console as a “Project”

#oc get projects

Shows OpenShift projects

May hide some system namespaces depending on RBAC


# Nodes

node in OpenShift is basically a machine (server or VM) in the cluster where OpenShift runs workloads and system components.

👉 Think of a node as a worker in a factory.The cluster is the entire factory.

Each node has a role:

Some nodes manage the cluster → control‑plane/master nodes

Some nodes run applications → worker nodes

oc get nodes -o wide

oc describe node <node-name>

oc adm top nodes  # gives cpu and memory usage of nodes

# Pods - have one/more containers

A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes/OCP.
👉 Think of a Pod as a box that contains one or more containers that always run together.

✔ Pod has its own IP

Each Pod gets an IP from the cluster network.

✔ Pod is ephemeral

If a pod crashes, Kubernetes creates a new one with a different IP.

So pod IPs are NOT permanent.

✔ Pod run inside a Node

Scheduler decides which node.

✔ Pod is controlled by higher-level objects:

Deployment

StatefulSet

DaemonSet

ReplicaSet

You should NOT create pods manually for apps in production.

oc get pods -A

oc get pods -A -o wide

oc describe pod <pod-name>

oc get pod <pod-name> -o yaml

oc exec -it <pod-name> -- bash

oc logs -f <pod-name>

Pods cannot be restarted directly.

You restart the deployment:  oc rollout restart deployment <deployment-name>

You restart the statefulset:    oc rollout restart statefulset <sts-name>

oc delete pod <pod-name>

oc debug pod/<pod-name>


# Pod lifecycle events:

Pending → Pod accepted, waiting for scheduling

Scheduled → Assigned to a node

ContainerCreating → Images pulled, volumes attached

Running → Pod is healthy and serving

CrashLoopBackOff → Container keeps crashing

ImagePullBackOff / Error → Image issues

Terminating → Pod shutting down

Succeeded → Completed and exited 0

Failed → Pod finished with errors

# Deployment

A Deployment is a higher‑level controller that manages Pods for you.

Deployment = A manager that ensures your desired number of Pod replicas are always running.


Key Features of Deployments:

✔️ Pods self‑heal (restart if failed)

✔️ Rolling updates (0-downtime upgrade)

✔️ Rollbacks (if new version fails)

✔️ Scaling up/down

✔️ Version history maintained

✔️ Declarative configuration (YAML)
